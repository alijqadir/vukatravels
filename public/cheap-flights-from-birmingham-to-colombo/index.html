<p>As we discussed earlier, planning a trip to Sri Lanka requires finding affordable flights that suit your needs. With our expert team guiding you, let's dive deeper into getting the cheapest possible options for your journey.</p>
<h4>Step 1: Understanding Your Options</h4>
<p>When searching for flights, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Direct vs Non-stop Flights: While non-stop might seem appealing due to less travel time and hassle, it may not always be cheaper. Be prepared to weigh these trade-offs.</li>
  <li>Airlines with layovers can sometimes offer lower fares, but factor in additional waiting times and potential connection risks.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Baggage Allowance</h4>
<p>Don't forget about baggage! Ensure you understand each airline's allowance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check the carrier's website for their standard luggage policy.</li>
  <li>Some airlines might charge extra for checked bags or impose weight limits. Be prepared to pay extra if needed.</li>
  <li>If you have specific requirements (e.g., musical instruments), plan accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Connection Guidance</h4>
<p>If a layover is unavoidable, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Opt for flights with reasonable connection times; typically less than 2 hours for international connections.</li>
  <li>Look into airlines that offer free lounge access to help alleviate waiting time stress.</li>
  <li>Some airports might have dedicated lounges or premium facilities for passengers; explore these options.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Baggage Guidance</h3>
<p>Don't worry about excess baggage charges! We'll help you pack smart with our expert guidance on hand luggage allowances, extra baggage fees and more.</p>
<p>When checking out your flights from Birmingham to Colombo, it's essential to consider your baggage needs. As mentioned earlier, our live fare checks can give you an instant update on flight prices and availability, but let's dive into the nitty-gritty of packing wisely.</p>
<p><strong>Hand Luggage Allowances</strong></p>
<p>Each airline has its own hand luggage allowance, which usually includes a maximum weight and size limit for carry-on bags. For example:</p>
<p>* British Airways: 23 kg (50 lbs) with a maximum size of 56 x 45 x 25 cm</p>
<p>* SriLankan Airlines: 7 kg (15 lbs) with a maximum size of 56 x 36 x 23 cm</p>
<p><strong>Extra Baggage Fees</strong></p>
<p>If you need to check-in additional bags, be aware that extra baggage fees apply. These can range from £20-£100 or more per bag, depending on the airline and route.</p>
<p><strong>Packing Tips</strong></p>
<p>* Be mindful of prohibited items in your carry-on and checked luggage</p>
<p>* Pack essentials like medications, chargers, and travel documents in your hand luggage</p>
<p>* Consider packing clothes that can be easily mixed-and-matched to reduce luggage space</p>
<p><strong>Questions to Ask Your Airline</strong></p>
<p>Before booking your flights, ask the airline about:</p>
<p>* Hand luggage allowance details</p>
<p>* Extra baggage fees and any restrictions on checked luggage size or weight</p>
<p>* Any special requirements for items like musical instruments or sports equipment</p>
<h3>Connection Guidance</h3>
<p>Need a connection? Our system will show you the best routes from Birmingham to Colombo, ensuring minimal layovers and maximum convenience.</p>
<p>If you're unsure about your baggage allowance after packing smart with our guidance (see previous section), it's essential to consider the impact of connections on your journey. A single connection can add significant time to your travel plans, but sometimes it might be unavoidable or even beneficial.</p>
<p>Before booking a connecting flight from Birmingham to Colombo:</p>
<p>* Check if you have sufficient time between flights for immigration and baggage collection. A general rule is to allow at least 2-3 hours.</p>
<p>* Consider the airline's policy on interlining (transferring) your checked luggage. Some airlines may not offer this service, so be aware of potential extra fees or delays.</p>
<p>When booking a connection:</p>
<p>1. Look for airlines with hub airports in between Birmingham and Colombo to reduce layovers.</p>
<p>2. Check if the connecting flight is operated by the same airline as your initial leg (this can simplify procedures).</p>
<p>3. Be prepared to ask:</p>
<p>	+ What's the minimum luggage allowance for each flight?</p>
<p>	+ Are there any additional fees for checked or hand baggage on either leg?</p>
<p>	+ Can you keep an eye on your bag throughout the journey, or will it be sent directly to Colombo?</p>
<p>Remember that connections can bring trade-offs. While they may save you money by reducing overall travel time (compared to a direct flight), you'll need to factor in extra time for layovers and potential delays.</p>
<p>To make informed decisions:</p>
<p>* Compare routes with different connections using our live fare check feature.</p>
<p>* Consider booking flights that depart early morning, as these often have better connection options due to reduced traffic in major hubs.</p>
<p>With our system, you can explore various connections and make an informed choice for your journey from Birmingham to Colombo.</p>

<p>	+ Consider the weight limit (typically 20-30kg)</p>
<p>	+ Look for airlines offering free checked bags or competitive rates</p>
<p>* <strong>Connection Guidance</strong>: We've already explored this, but it's crucial to understand the layover times and any potential risks of missed connections</p>
<p>* <strong>Flight Flexibility</strong>: Can you adjust your travel dates or times to suit cheaper flights?</p>
<p>	+ Be aware that changes may incur fees (around £10-£50)</p>
<p>When booking, ask yourself:</p>
