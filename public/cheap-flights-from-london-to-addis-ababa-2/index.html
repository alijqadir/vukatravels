<p>Now that you've found a suitable connecting flight from London to Addis Ababa, it's essential to check the baggage allowance for your journey. Each airline has its own set of rules regarding what can be carried in the cabin or checked in as part of your ticket.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Hand Luggage Allowance</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Check with your airline for the hand luggage size and weight restrictions.</li>
  <li>Ensure that your carry-on bag meets these dimensions (typically 56 x 45 x 25 cm) to avoid any issues at check-in.</li>
  <li>Consider wearing your heaviest or bulkiest items, such as coat or boots, to save space in your luggage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Checked Baggage Allowance</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Check with your airline for the checked baggage allowance in terms of weight and number of bags allowed.</li>
  <li>Be aware that most airlines have a minimum size requirement for checked bags (around 90 x 75 x 43 cm).</li>
  <li>Don't forget to check if your flight includes any additional fees for excess baggage or overweight luggage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Questions to Ask Your Airline</strong></p>

<p>When deciding on your travel arrangements, consider the following:</p>
<p>* If you have a lot of luggage, you may want to opt for a direct flight from London to Addis Ababa.</p>
<p>* However, direct flights might be more expensive than connecting options with better baggage allowances.</p>
<p>* Weigh up these trade-offs and make an informed decision based on your specific needs.</p>
<p><strong>Baggage Tracking</strong></p>
<p>Keep track of your bags throughout the journey:</p>
<p>* Use luggage tags or stickers provided by the airline to identify your checked bags.</p>
<p>* Keep your carry-on bag easily accessible in case you need it during the flight.</p>
<p>* If you notice any issues with your luggage, report them immediately to the airline staff.</p>
