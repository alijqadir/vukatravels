<p><strong>Use a flight comparison tool</strong>: Websites like Skyscanner, Kayak, or Google Flights allow you to compare prices across various airlines in one place.</p>
<p><strong>Consider multiple airports</strong>: If you're flying from the UK, don't limit yourself to just London airports. Other major airports like Manchester, Birmingham, or Glasgow might offer cheaper flights with a layover.</p>
<p><strong>Be flexible with travel dates</strong>: Prices can fluctuate depending on the day of the week and time of year. If possible, try to be flexible with your travel dates to find better deals.</p>
<p><strong>Read reviews and check airline policies</strong>: Research the airlines operating direct flights from the UK to Karachi and read reviews from other passengers. Check their baggage policies, in-flight entertainment options, and customer service reputation.</p>
<h4>Common Hidden Costs to Watch Out For</h4>
<p><strong>Additional baggage fees</strong>: Some airlines may charge extra for checked or hand luggage.</p>
<p><strong>Seat selection fees</strong>: If you want to choose your seat, be prepared for an additional fee.</p>
<p><strong>Food and drink charges</strong>: Some airlines may charge for in-flight meals or snacks.</p>
<p><strong>Travel insurance</strong>: Make sure you have adequate travel insurance that covers unexpected medical or travel-related expenses.</p>
<h4>Tips for Avoiding Hidden Costs</h4>
<p><strong>Check the airline's website for package deals</strong>: Sometimes, booking a flight and accommodation together can be cheaper than purchasing them separately.</p>
<p><strong>Use your credit card rewards</strong>: If you have a credit card with travel rewards, use it to book your flights and earn points or miles.</p>
<p><strong>Be aware of exchange rates</strong>: If you're paying in pounds, be mindful of the exchange rate when booking flights in rupees.</p>
