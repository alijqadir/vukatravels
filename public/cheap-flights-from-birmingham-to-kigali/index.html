<h3>Baggage Allowance Guidance</h3>
<p>Don't get caught out by baggage restrictions! Our expert advice helps you pack smart and avoid extra fees.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Your Airline's Baggage Policy</strong></p>
<p>Before your flight from Birmingham to Kigali, it's essential to familiarize yourself with your airline's baggage allowance. Check the airline's website or consult their customer service for information on:</p>
<p>* Hand luggage size and weight limits</p>
<p>* Checked baggage allowances (e.g., 20kg, 25kg)</p>
<p>* Excess baggage fees</p>
<p><strong>Packing Smart: Tips and Tricks</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong>Know Your Airline's Size Restrictions</strong>: Familiarize yourself with the maximum dimensions of hand luggage allowed by your airline.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Weight vs. Volume</strong>: If you have a lot of bulky items (e.g., jackets, shoes), consider packing them in your checked baggage to avoid weight restrictions on your hand luggage.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Maximize Your Checked Baggage</strong>: Pack essential items like clothes and toiletries in a carry-on bag, leaving space for souvenirs or extra purchases during your trip.</p>
<p><strong>Questions to Ask</strong></p>

<p>* How much do excess baggage fees cost?</p>
<p><strong>Trade-Offs: Hand Luggage vs. Checked Baggage</strong></p>
<p>Consider the following when deciding what to pack in hand luggage or checked baggage:</p>
<p>* <strong>Essential Items</strong>: Pack essential items like medication, phone charger, and travel documents in your carry-on bag.</p>
<p>* <strong>Valuables</strong>: Consider packing valuable items (e.g., laptops, jewelry) in a separate, easily accessible bag within your checked luggage.</p>
<p>* <strong>Comfort Items</strong>: If you have specific comfort items (e.g., pillows, blankets), pack them in your hand luggage to ensure their availability during the flight.</p>
<p><strong>Final Check</strong></p>
<p>Before checking in online or at the airport:</p>
<p>1. Review your airline's baggage policy and any relevant restrictions.</p>
