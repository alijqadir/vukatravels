<p><strong>Baggage Guidance</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to baggage, it's essential to check with your airline in advance to avoid any last-minute surprises. Here are some key questions to ask:</p>
<p>* What is the maximum weight and size of my checked luggage?</p>
<p>* Are there any restrictions on carry-on bags or items like laptops or liquids?</p>
<p>* Can I purchase additional baggage allowance if needed?</p>
<p>Most airlines offer a generous baggage allowance, but it's always better to double-check. Remember, unexpected charges can quickly add up, so be sure to factor in the cost of extra luggage when booking your flights.</p>
<p><strong>Connection Guidance</strong></p>
<p>If you're planning to connect through another airport, make sure to check the airline's policy on layovers and connections. Some airlines may offer more generous connection times than others, while some may charge for checked baggage at connecting airports.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to keep in mind:</p>
<p>* Check with your airline about their minimum connection time (MCT) policies.</p>
<p>* Consider booking flights with shorter layovers or non-stop options if possible.</p>
<p>* Be prepared for any unexpected delays or changes in your itinerary.</p>
<p>By staying informed and planning ahead, you can ensure a smooth journey from London to Entebbe. Our live fare checker is here to help you navigate the complex world of flight prices and find the best deals for your next adventure.</p>
<h3>Baggage Guidance</h3>
<p>Know your baggage allowance before booking. Check airline rules on hand luggage, checked bags, and excess weight fees to avoid surprises at check-in.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a great deal on cheap flights from London to Entebbe, it's essential to factor in the costs of carrying extra baggage. Did our live fare checker help you find your ideal flight?</p>
<p>When booking your ticket, consider the following:</p>
<p>* Check the airline's hand luggage allowance: what size bag can you bring onboard?</p>
<p>* Verify the checked baggage policy: how many bags are included, and what's the weight limit per piece?</p>
<p>* Are excess weight fees charged? If so, at what rate?</p>
<p>Don't assume all airlines have the same rules; each has its own set of guidelines. Make sure to review your airline's baggage policy before you book:</p>
<p>| Airline | Hand Luggage Allowance (cm) | Checked Bags (max 2) | Excess Weight Fee (£ per kg) |</p>
<p>| --- | --- | --- | --- |</p>
<p>| Airline A | 56 x 45 x 25 cm | 23kg each, up to 32kg total | £5-£10 per kg |</p>
<p>When packing for your trip:</p>
<p>* Pack essentials in hand luggage (e.g., passport, phone charger, medication)</p>
<p>* Consider shipping non-essential items separately</p>
<p>* Leave some extra space in your checked bags for souvenirs or purchases during your stay</p>
<p>Questions to ask yourself when booking:</p>
<p>* Can I afford the excess weight fees?</p>
<p>* Will my baggage fit within the airline's allowances?</p>
<p>* Am I prepared to pay for any additional baggage costs?</p>
<p>Don't let unexpected baggage charges ruin your budget. Be aware of the rules, and plan accordingly.</p>

<h3>Connection Options</h3>
<p>Having a clear understanding of baggage allowance is just one aspect to consider when planning your trip. Now, let's explore how you can get from London to Entebbe with minimal hassle.</p>
<p>When searching for flights, it's essential to check not only the direct connections but also any layovers or transit times involved. A shorter connection might seem appealing, but what if it means a higher risk of missed flights due to tight schedules? Weighing these factors can be complex, which is why we're here to guide you through the process.</p>
<h4>Choosing Your Connection</h4>
<p>Before finalising your booking, consider the following questions:</p>
<p>* What's the minimum layover time required for my flight?</p>
<p>* Are there any layovers that are too short or long for comfort?</p>
<p>* Do I need to check in for each leg of my journey separately?</p>
<p>To make informed decisions, always check with your airline about their policies on:</p>
<p>* Hand luggage allowances and restrictions</p>
<p>* Checked baggage fees and weight limits</p>
<p>* Excess weight charges (if applicable)</p>
<p>Understanding these aspects can help you avoid last-minute surprises at the airport.</p>
<h4>Tips for Managing Your Connection</h4>
<p>1. <strong>Check-in online</strong>: Where possible, take advantage of online check-in to speed up your process.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Print or download your boarding pass</strong>: Avoid any delays by having your boarding passes readily available.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Plan ahead</strong>: If you're connecting through a hub airport, research its layout and know where your gates are located.</p>
<p><strong>What to Ask Your Airline</strong></p>
<p>Before booking, ask about their policy on:</p>
<p>* Connecting flights and transfer times</p>
<p>* Baggage handling during layovers</p>
<p>* Any specific requirements for international travel</p>
<p>By taking these steps, you can ensure a smoother journey from London to Entebbe.</p>
