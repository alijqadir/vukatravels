<h3>{'id': 'baggage-and-connection', 'title': 'Baggage Allowance and Connection Guidance', 'description': "Ensure you have the correct baggage allowance and connection times with our handy guidance. Don't get caught out!", 'image': 'illustration of a plane with suitcases and clock'}</h3>
<p>With live fare checks now complete, let's turn our attention to two crucial aspects of your journey: baggage allowance and connection guidance.</p>
<h4>Baggage Allowance</h4>
<p>When booking flights from London to Dhaka, it's essential to understand the baggage allowance policy of your chosen airline. Typically, airlines offer a standard luggage allowance, which can vary between 20-30kg per passenger, depending on the class of travel. However, this allowance may not be applicable for checked-in bags or hold luggage.</p>
<p>To ensure you're within the allowed limits:</p>
<p>* Check your airline's baggage policy carefully before booking</p>
<p>* Consider packing essential items in a carry-on bag to avoid additional fees</p>
<p>* Weigh and measure your luggage accurately to avoid any unexpected charges</p>
<p>Some airlines also offer extra baggage options, which can be booked in advance. These may include:</p>
<p>* Extra hold luggage (e.g., 10-20kg)</p>
<p>* Priority baggage handling (for an additional fee)</p>
<h4>Connection Guidance</h4>
<p>When traveling from London to Dhaka with a layover or connection, it's vital to plan carefully to avoid any potential disruptions.</p>
<p>To ensure a smooth journey:</p>
<p>* Check your airline's minimum connecting time (MCT) policy</p>
<p>* Plan for at least 2 hours of layover time in case of unexpected delays</p>
<p>* Consider booking flights with shorter connections if possible</p>
<p>Some airlines may offer "connection insurance" or protection against flight cancellations or changes. However, these policies can vary between airlines and are not always comprehensive.</p>
<p>When booking your flights, ask the airline about their baggage and connection policies to avoid any confusion later on.</p>

<p>*   <strong>Price Flexibility</strong>: Be flexible with your travel dates, as prices often fluctuate depending on demand.</p>

<h4>**Checking Prices**</h4>
<p>To get the best deals, consider using a flight comparison tool or directly visiting airline websites. Be aware of any additional fees for baggage, food, or seat selection.</p>
<p>When comparing prices, ask yourself:</p>
<p>*   Are there any promotional codes or discounts available?</p>
