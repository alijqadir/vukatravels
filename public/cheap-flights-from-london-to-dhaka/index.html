<p>* <strong>Duration</strong>: Select flights with layovers or non-stop options</p>
<p><strong>Baggage Guidance</strong></p>
<p>When searching for cheap flights, be mindful of baggage allowances. Most airlines charge extra for checked bags, so consider the following:</p>
<p>* <strong>Hand luggage only</strong>: Pack light to avoid additional fees</p>
<p>* <strong>Checked bag allowance</strong>: Check the airline's policy on checked baggage and factor in any extra costs</p>
<p>* <strong>Weight limits</strong>: Be aware of weight limits for carry-on luggage</p>
<p><strong>Connection Guidance</strong></p>
<p>If you're looking for cheap flights with a layover, consider the following:</p>
<p>* <strong>Short vs. long connections</strong>: Do you prefer shorter or longer layovers? Shorter connections may be more convenient but longer ones can be cheaper</p>
<p>* <strong>Airline alliances</strong>: Some airlines have partner agreements that allow for smoother connections</p>

<h4>How Live Fare Checks Work</h4>
<p>Our system continuously monitors flight prices in real-time, allowing us to provide you with the most up-to-date information. This means you can make informed decisions about your travel plans without having to spend hours researching.</p>
<h4>Tips for Using Our Live Fare Checks:</h4>

<h4>Questions to Ask Yourself:</h4>
<p>* How flexible are your travel dates? If you can fly during off-peak hours or on less busy days, you may be able to secure a cheaper ticket.</p>
<p>* Are there any specific baggage requirements for your trip? If so, factor these into your price comparisons.</p>
<p>* Do you mind taking a connecting flight? While non-stop flights might seem more convenient, connections can sometimes work out cheaper.</p>
<h4>Trade-Offs:</h4>
<p>* Extra legroom vs. cheaper seat: Some airlines offer extra legroom seats at an additional cost. Weigh up whether this is worth the extra expense for your trip.</p>
<p>* Baggage allowance vs. paying per kilo: If you have a lot of luggage, it might be more cost-effective to pay for excess baggage rather than opting for a higher baggage allowance.</p>
<h4>Best Practices:</h4>
<p>* Use our live fare checks regularly: Prices can fluctuate rapidly, so keep an eye on prices before making your final decision.</p>
<p>* Be mindful of fuel surcharges and taxes: These can significantly impact the overall price of your ticket.</p>
<h3>Baggage Guidance</h3>
<p>Need help with baggage allowance? Our guide explains the basics, so you can pack smart and avoid extra charges.</p>
<p>When booking your cheap flights from London to Dhaka, it's essential to understand the baggage policy of your airline. Most airlines offer a free baggage allowance, but excess baggage fees can quickly add up.</p>
<p><strong>What are the key things to consider?</strong></p>
<p>*   <strong>Weight vs Volume</strong>: Check if your airline uses weight or volume-based baggage allowances.</p>
<p>*   <strong>Number of Bags</strong>: Confirm how many bags you're allowed to bring and their maximum weight/size.</p>
<p>*   <strong>Excess Baggage Fees</strong>: Understand what happens when you exceed your free allowance.</p>
<p><strong>Questions to Ask Your Airline</strong></p>
<p>Before booking, ask your airline about:</p>
<p>*   <strong>Baggage restrictions</strong>: Are there any items prohibited or restricted on the flight?</p>
<p>*   <strong>Special requirements</strong>: Do you need to declare anything, such as valuable items or sporting equipment?</p>
<p><strong>Packing Tips & Tricks</strong></p>
<p>To avoid excess baggage fees and make the most of your baggage allowance:</p>
<p>*   <strong>Pack light</strong>: Aim for a carry-on only or pack essentials in your hand luggage.</p>
<p>*   <strong>Choose multi-purpose items</strong>: Select clothes that can be easily mixed-and-matched.</p>
<p>*   <strong>Utilise every available space</strong>: Make the most of your bag's pockets and compartments.</p>
